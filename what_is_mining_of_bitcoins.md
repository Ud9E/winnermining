Bitcoin mining refers to the process of verifying and adding transaction records to the blockchain ledger. This process involves solving complex mathematical puzzles using powerful computers. The term "mining" is used because it resembles the extraction of resources like gold. Miners compete to solve these puzzles first, and the winner gets rewarded with newly minted bitcoins (BTC). 
The process of mining plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the Bitcoin network. It ensures that all transactions are legitimate and prevents fraud. Additionally, miners receive transaction fees from users who want their transactions processed quickly. As of now, the reward for mining one block is 6.25 BTC, but this amount halves approximately every four years through an event known as the "halving."

Bitcoin mining requires significant investment in hardware such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are specifically designed for mining cryptocurrencies. Additionally, miners must consider energy costs since the computational power needed consumes vast amounts of electricity. Despite these challenges, many individuals and companies continue to engage in mining due to its potential profitability.
