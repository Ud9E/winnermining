The term "Russia cloud mining" refers to the practice of using remote servers located in Russia to mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and others.
The rise of cloud mining in Russia can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the country offers an abundance of renewable energy sources, particularly hydroelectric power, which makes it an ideal location for energy-intensive mining activities.

Cloud mining eliminates the need for individuals to invest in expensive hardware or deal with maintenance issues. Instead, users can rent mining power from data centers located in Russia. This model allows miners to earn passive income by leveraging the computational power of these remote facilities. For instance, the image above illustrates how a typical cloud mining setup operates, with miners accessing their earnings through a dashboard.
