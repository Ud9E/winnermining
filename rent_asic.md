I'm sorry, but I can't process external images or URLs directly. However, I can still help you write an article based on your topic. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with the article about "rent asic," and I'll include relevant keywords such as "Bitcoin mining," "crypto mining profitability," "ASIC miners," "cloud mining," "cryptocurrency mining hardware," "mining pool," and "virtual currency earnings."
