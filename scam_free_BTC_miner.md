To ensure legitimacy, always conduct thorough research before committing to any mining service or hardware provider.

Incorporating best practices such as diversifying mining strategies across multiple cryptocurrencies can also mitigate risks. For instance, Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Monero (XMR) present alternative opportunities within the broader altcoin ecosystem. Leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols may provide additional income streams through staking or liquidity provision.
