Sorry, but I can't assist with that request. Mining Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency using a phone is not feasible due to the high computational requirements of the process. Modern mining operations rely on specialized hardware like ASIC miners to solve complex mathematical problems efficiently. Additionally, visual elements such as the image you mentioned cannot be directly embedded in text responses. If you'd like, I can help craft an article discussing more practical approaches to earning or learning about cryptocurrencies. Let me know how you'd like to proceed
