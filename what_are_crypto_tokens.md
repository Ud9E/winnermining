# What Are Crypto Tokens?
Crypto tokens represent digital assets that exist on blockchain networks. They can be used for various purposes, such as accessing services, storing value, or even participating in decentralized governance within a project. Tokens are often created through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which allow projects to raise funds by selling tokens to investors.
One of the most popular types of crypto tokens is utility tokens, which grant holders access to specific services or products offered by the platform. For instance, Filecoin (FIL) allows users to buy and sell storage space on its decentralized network. Another type is security tokens, which are essentially digitized versions of traditional securities like stocks or bonds. Security tokens may provide token holders with dividends, equity, or voting rights depending on the underlying asset.
Mining plays an essential role in securing many blockchains where crypto tokens reside. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are two well-known examples of cryptocurrencies that rely heavily on mining processes to verify transactions and add new blocks to their respective ledgers. Miners use powerful computers equipped with specialized hardware—such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)—to solve complex mathematical problems required for mining activities. Successful miners earn newly minted tokens as rewards along with transaction fees paid by other participants.
Staking is another method some blockchain networks employ instead of mining to maintain network integrity while generating income opportunities for validators who hold large amounts of native cryptocurrencies. Validators lock up their holdings as collateral and participate in consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In return, they receive regular payouts proportional to the amount staked.
Understanding how crypto tokens work alongside concepts like mining and staking is crucial for anyone looking into this rapidly evolving field. As more innovative applications emerge across industries ranging from finance to supply chain management, staying informed about these technologies could lead to profitable ventures in the future.
